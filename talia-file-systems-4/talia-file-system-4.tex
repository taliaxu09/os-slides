    \slidetitle{What can happen on a crash?}

    Assume we are creating and writing to a new file /foo/bar

    Write in general (not just the first write)

    \slidetitle{What can happen on a crash?}
    
    Assume we are creating and writing to a new file /foo/bar
    \bigskip

    A crash after the completion of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Step   1-5: No corruption.
        \item Step     6: i-node bitmap points to garbage data.
        \item Step   7-9: Inconsistent metadata.
        \item Step 10-12: No corruption.  
        \item Step    13: data bitmap points to garbage data.
        \item Step    14: Corrupted data.
        \item Step    15: The new data cannot be found. 
    \end{itemize}

    \slidetitle{What can happen on a crash?}

    \textbf{Lost Files:} New files being created might not be fully registered in the directory structure, leading to them being "lost" even if their data exists on disk.
    \bigskip

    \textbf{Inaccessible Files:} Existing files might become inaccessible due to corrupted metadata or lost pointers to their data blocks.
    \bigskip
    
    \textbf{Incorrect File Sizes:} The file system might report incorrect file sizes due to incomplete writes or metadata updates.
    \bigskip

    \textbf{Inconsistent Metadata:} Applications trying to access affected files might crash, freeze, or produce errors due to the inconsistencies.

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Recovery from failure}

    \textbf{Consistency checking} compares data in directory structure with data blocks on disk, and tries to fix inconsistencies.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tools: fsck for Unix systems, chkdsk for Windows.
        \item Scanning the entire disk, slow, very slow ...
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    \textbf{Journaling:} A system that keeps track of changes that will be made in the file system to ensure data integrity.
    \bigskip

    \textbf{Versioning and Snapshots:} Maintain historical versions or states of files and systems to roll back when needed.
    \bigskip

    \textbf{Backup and Restore:} Periodic backups to external devices or cloud storage, ensuring data can be restored from a known good state.

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Journaling (a.k.a Write-Ahead Logging)} 

    Used by many modern file systems: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Linux (ext3, ext4), Windows (NTFS), IBM (JFS)
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    First write down what you are going to do, and then carry out the action

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Journaling (a.k.a Write-Ahead Logging)} 

    Physical journal
    \begin{itemize}
        \item all changed data is recorded in the journal first
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    Logical journal
    \begin{itemize}
        \item only changed metadata (like inode tables, directory structures) is recorded
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Journaling (a.k.a Write-Ahead Logging)} 

    What if absolute data integrity is crucial?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item for example, in banking, aviation systems, stock exchange?
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip
    
    How do we ensure that data integrity is always maintained?

    \slidetitle{Why distributed system? An example}

    2004: Facebook started on a single server
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Web server front end to assemble each user’s page. 
        \item Database to store posts, friend lists, etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    2008: 100M users
    \medskip

    2010: 500M users
    \medskip

    2012: 1B users
    \medskip

    2019: 2.5B users
    \medskip

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{An example scenario}

    For a web-based service to be available, both the server and the web server need to be operational.
    \bigskip

    In this scenario, both the server and the web server are hosted on a single machine.
    \bigskip

    This machine has a 10\% chance of failure.
    \bigskip

    What is the overall availability of the service, assuming no other components fail?

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{An example scenario}

    Now the server and the web server are each hosted on a different machine.
    \bigskip

    Each machine has a 10\% chance of failure.
    \bigskip

    What is the overall availability of the service, assuming no other components fail?

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{An example scenario}

    As the service grows, the user base expands, and more content is required.
    \bigskip

    To support this, 10 machines are dedicated to the servers, and another 10 are allocated for the web servers.
    \bigskip

    Each machine has a 10\% chance of failure.
    \bigskip

    What is the overall availability of the service, assuming no other components fail?

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{An example scenario}

    The service provider aims to reduce their failure rate to below 1\% by creating replicas of their servers and web servers.
    \bigskip

    How many replicas are needed?

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Why distributed system?}

    Nature of the application
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiplayer games
        \item Collaborative Projects \& Cloud App
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    Availability despite unreliable components 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A service shouldn’t fail when one computer does. • 
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    Conquer geographic separation 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A web request in NZ is faster served by a server in NZ than by a server in US.
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    Scale up capacity 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More CPU cycles, more memory, more storage
    \end{itemize}

    \slidetitle{What is a distributed system?}

    \includegraphics[width=65mm]{dfs-definition-1.png}
    \bigskip

    \textbf{Independent components or elements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item software processes or hardware used to run a process, store data, etc.
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{What is a distributed system?}

    \includegraphics[width=65mm]{dfs-definition-2.png}
    \bigskip

    \textbf{Independent components or elements} that are \textbf{connected by a network.}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{What is a distributed system?}

    \includegraphics[width=80mm]{dfs-definition-4.png}
    \bigskip

    \textbf{Independent components or elements} that are \textbf{connected by a network} and \textbf{communicate by passing messages} to achieve a common goal, appearing as \textbf{a single coherent system}.
    \bigskip

    When one (or more) component fails, the system does not fail.

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{The client-server model}

    \includegraphics[width=80mm]{client-server-model.png}
    \bigskip

    Unstructured communication 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use shared memory or shared data structures
    \end{itemize}

    Structured communication 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Message-oriented model
    \end{itemize}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Remote service - stateful}

    Server knows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item who has the file open
        \item for what type of access
        \item and where it is in the file etc.
        \item When the client calls open, it receives an identifier to be used to access the file.
        \item Looks very similar to traditional local file access to the client process.
        \item Efficient, the needed data may be read ahead by the server.
        \item Information about the file is held in memory.
        \item If the server crashes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item it is difficult to start again since all the state information is lost.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Server has problems with processes which die
        \begin{itemize}
            \item needs to occasionally check.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Remote service - stateless}

    Server does not maintain information on the state of the system. It merely responds to requests.
    \bigskip

    Open and close calls don’t send messages to the server. Handled locally. (Except for access privileges.)
    \bigskip

    Requesting processor has topass all the extra information with each read/write
    \begin{itemize}
        \item e.g., the current file location the process is reading from, accesibility
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    Server doesn't have to worry about processes stopping
    \bigskip

    No complicated recovery process if the server goes down
