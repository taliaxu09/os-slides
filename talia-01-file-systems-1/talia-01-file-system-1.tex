    \slidetitle{I'm Talia, your instructor}
	
    I am a lecturer in the Computer Systems Group.
    \bigskip

    I am about to receive my PhD from TU Delft.
    \bigskip

   I previously went to University of Toronto for BASc and MASc.

    \slidetitle{I'm Talia, your instructor}

    I worked at a few industry places, mostly as an intern 
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Canada: IBM, Arista Networks, Amazon
	\item US: Reach Power (startup)
	\item UK: Nokia Bell Labs
    \end{itemize}

    \bigskip
    My research interest is 
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Using light for communication and sensing
	\item Novel sensing systems for health / mental well-beings
	\item Generally involvesome hardware or embedded systems
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{End of Moore's Law:} The traditional approach of relying on exponential hardware improvement is no longer sustainable.
        \item \textbf{Shifting Demands:} The growing demand for machine learning and data processing requires a different approach to computing infrastructure.
        \item \textbf{System-Level Optimization:} Optimizing the entire system, rather than individual components, can unlock greater gains in capacity and capability.
    \end{itemize}

    \slidetitle{File System: How to manage a persistent device?}

    What are the APIs?
    \bigskip

    What are the important aspects of the implementation?

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{File system: How to manage a persistent device?}

    You have a 1 MB file named foo stored in the directory /bar
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the full path name of the file?
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    How are files organized on the disk? 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What data structures are used to store the data of the file?
        \item The metadata?
        \item The location?
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    How do you access data on the disk?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When you open/write/read the file, what function calls are evoked?
        \item If we write another 1MB data to /bar/foo, where does this data go?
        \item Which structures on the disks are read from and written to?
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}

    \slidetitle{File system is an abstract concept}

    A File system describes a way of organizing and storing files on a storage device.

    What are some requirements of a file system?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Availability:} Ensure data can be accessed and used reliably.
        \item \textbf{Permanence:} Store data permanently (or an approximation of it).
        \item \textbf{Concurrent Access:} Make data sharable with other programs or users
    \end{itemize}

    \slidetitle{File system implementations are design choices}

    \includegraphics[width=64mm]{file-system-implementation.png}
    
    Some popular file system implementations: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unix (Linux and Mac)
        \item Windows
        \item Specialized system (Mainframe)
    \end{itemize}
